For the web building part, they are using django. Django is an open-sourced web building structure which is based on Python. It mainly concentrate on the Model(M), Template(T) and View(V) which is also known as the MTV mode.I used it in my program too. 
For the database part, they are using MySQL. MySQL is the most commonly used SQL database and often evaluated as the best one. Choosing MySQL is a great move.
For the model building part, they are using keras. Their main building part includes unet and inception v3 model. Inception v3 model is a classic GoogleNet network which often used to solve the image segmentation problem.
